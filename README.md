## Decoupled Kit Application from Acquia

### About 

This is a starter application built as a baseline for creating React applications which rely heavily on API data from external sources. This application was forked from the [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) application and the full documentation has been moved in `docs\React-Slingshot.md`. This application has included a considerable amount of features to be leveraged as best practices around workflow, structure, testing, and much more. The examples are intentionally basic to provide clarity around the intents of the components.

### Installation 

- Install <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/">yarn</a> or also use `npm` for dependencies.
- Install packages with `yarn install` or `npm install`
- Stand up the application with `yarn start` or `npm start` and visit `http://localhost:8080`
